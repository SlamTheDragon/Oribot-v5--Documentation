A brief explanation of how Moderation System works.


## Permission Levels
Here are the permission levels that the Oribot uses.
- New User `visitor`
- Validated User `member`
- Moderator `moderator`
- Bot Admin `admin`

See [Admin Commands](#Admin%20Commands), [Permission System](Permission%20System.md), and [Safety & Setup](Safety%20&%20Setup) on how to set user permissions.
